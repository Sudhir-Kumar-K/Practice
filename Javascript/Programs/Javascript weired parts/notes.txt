Javascript supports prototypal inheritance.

When an accessed property is not present in the object, its protype object will be searched, if it is not foundt in its
prototype, protype's prototype will be looked and in that way, prototype chain is traversed untill property is found or protype
chain is ended.

Function constructors are just functions called with new keyword. These functions have 2 specialities
    -- 'new' keyword creates an empty object.
    -- 'this' keyword inside the function will point to the empty object of previous step.
    -- automatically returns the created object. (without return statement inside the function)
