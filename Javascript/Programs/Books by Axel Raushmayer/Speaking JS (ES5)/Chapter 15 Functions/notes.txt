Function: 
        its a piece of work
        set of statements used to perform a specific task
        block of code which can be called/executed multiple times. 
In JS function take any of 3 roles.
    standalone / non-method function
        These are normal functions and can be called directly with name.
    constructor function
         These functions called with new keyword and return an object.
         So these are the factory functions (just like classes in object oriented programming like C#, C++, Java).
         by convention the name of these functions start with Uppercase. 
    method
      These are members of objects. 
      called with <<object_name>>.<<method_name>>

Parameter vs Argument
    Parameter: these are the formal arguments, used in function definition. 
    Argument:  these are the actual arguments, used in function calling.

Standalone functions: 
    In 3 ways we can create functions. 
        1. using function expression. 
            Function expression produces a value. 
            Which needs to be assigned to a variable for calling the function. 
        2. using function declaration. 
            Most of the time, function declaration is preferred way of creating a function. 
            Because of hoisting, function declarations automatically moves to top of the current scope. 
            So we can call the function before its declaration. 
        3. using function constructor.
            Function constructors are used to dynamically create functions from strings.
            -- But this approach many limitations, 
                -- Its slow and may lead to security breaches. 
                -- The created functions are always in global scope.  

Function Arguments ('arguments' keyword)

positional vs named params
