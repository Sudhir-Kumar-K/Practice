Type Conversion (Coercion) :

Automatic conversion of one type of value to other.

Coercion can happen with JS functions, operators or methods.

eg: the operands of the arithmatic operator (*) are coerced to numbers:

> '3' * '4'
12


if one of the operands is a string, the plus operator (+) converts the other one to a string:

> 3 + ' times'
'3 times'


Type Coercion Can Hide Bugs
When we get user inputs, generally they will be of string format even when numbers entered.

formData = {innerWidth:'100'}

let iw = width;
let  ow = width + 20;

console.log(iw,ow); // 100 , 10020 (string)

In these cases, we should convert them to numbers before hand
like iw = Number(width)
