Callbacks are the most common way of expressing asynchrony in JS programs.
Callback is the most fundamental async pattern in Javascript.

There are many callback patterns;
    -- split callback design
    -- error first style (sometimes called Node style)

Some functions take callbacks and executes them immediately 
    eg: forEach() (Synchronouse)
While some other functions take  callbacks and execute them in future
    eg: setTimeout() (These are asynchronous)
