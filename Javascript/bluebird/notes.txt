Bluebird package is preferred over inbuilt node promises and other 3rd party libraries, 
for details on it check 'why bluebird' section of the documentation. 

Promise.all takes array of promises as input and its promise handler(then()) will wait till all the promises completed, 
If all are resolved, it returns the array of promise results. 
If atleast one promise rejected, it returns with the error. 

Promise.any is same as promise.all but only difference is it will look for any one promise
resolution,
