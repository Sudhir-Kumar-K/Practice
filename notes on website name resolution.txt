DNS (Domain Name System) is maps website name to IP Address. 

1. When we type the web address in the browser, a query will go to RECURSIVE RESOLVER through ISP (Internet Service Provider)
2. RECURSIVE RESOLVER will identify the relevant RNS (Root Name Server)
3. RNS delegates the query to TLD (Top Level Domain) server
4. TLD Server will respond with IP address.
