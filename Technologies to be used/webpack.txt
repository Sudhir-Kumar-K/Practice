WebPack is  a module bundler
Its converts our application into one or more bundles and transfers to browser

It's an excellent alternative to the SystemJS

A bundle is a JavaScript file that incorporate assets that belong together and should be served to the client in a response to a single file request.
A bundle can include JavaScript, CSS styles, HTML, and almost any other kind of file.
[Most importantly, a bundle is available with single request]

In addition to javascript files, Webpack can preprocess and minify different non-JavaScript files such as TypeScript, SASS, and LESS files
