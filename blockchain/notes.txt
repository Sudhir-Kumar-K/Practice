Computing types: 
   --> centralised (like main-frames)
   --> cloud / client-server
   --> completely de-centralized

Distributed ledger will allow us to shift towards completely de-centralized computing: 
Briefly "Distributed ledgers give explicit control of digital-assets to end-users, without requiring to trust any third-party servers or infra-structures"

Ledger: In a general sense, ledger is a financial recording keeping book

Distributed (digital) Ledger: Its a data structures, which resides across multiple devices, locations and regions. 

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): It consists of 3 things: 
                                   i) A data model that captures the current state of ledger (set of transactions)
                                  ii) A language of transaction that changes the state of ledger
                                 iii) A protocol used to build the consesus (agreement) among the participants, around which transactions will be accepted by the ledger.

BLOCKCHAIN IS A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER + CONSENSUS + SMART CONTRACTS + Any other assistive technologies

Smart contracts are the computer programs which will be triggered when certain conditions are met.
